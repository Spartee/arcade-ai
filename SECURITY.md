## Security Best Practices

To help ensure the security of the project, please follow these best practices when contributing:

1. **Avoid hardcoding sensitive information**: Never hardcode API keys, passwords, or any sensitive data directly into the codebase. Use environment variables or secret management tools.
2. **Use HTTPS**: Always prefer HTTPS for communication with external services to avoid transmitting sensitive information over insecure channels.
3. **Regularly update dependencies**: Keep all dependencies up to date and monitor for vulnerabilities using automated tools like [Dependabot](https://github.com/dependabot).
4. **Use secure coding practices**: Follow secure coding standards and perform thorough code reviews to minimize security risks.
